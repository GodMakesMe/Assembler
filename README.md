Assembler 
My Group Partners have provided an Assembler PYTHON code with Automated Testing and GUI capability.

Here In this repository, I am uploading a zip file containing some of the test cases and my Assembler code inside the SimpleAssembler folder as the Assembler.py.

Assembler.py can be run in the GUI mode in which you need to edit the python file, make a=1, and run it normally
for the GUI version, you might need the Tkinter preinstalled in your system
to install Tkinter in Windows::    in Terminal::   pip install tkinter
Linux:    sudo apt-get install python3-tk

Normal mode:     Automated Testing Mode
Extract the Zip
In this mode, you need to open the automatedTesting folder.
And run the following command
python3 src\main.py --no-sim --windows                     # for the Windows
python3 src/main.py --no-sim --linux                       # for the Linux

I am also providing all the possible SimpleTestcases  with the testcases.txt
To run this in GUI, you will need to go to File Menu, then Go to the Open menu.
After that, select the testcases.txt  and Click on the Run Menu
You will see the output in the output field
BEWARE: This may take some time to process as there are 3 lakh 45 thousand 83 test cases

I am also providing the BONUSInstruction test cases as bonustestcases.txt separately, although it is there in the testcases.txt

For backup purposes, I am also providing the GUI version of the Py file separatory.
